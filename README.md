**Flask Application Design**

**Objective:** Build a website that analyzes Google stock.

**HTML Files:**

- **index.html:**
   - The homepage of the website.
   - Contains form elements for users to input various inputs for stock analysis.
   - Contains a container to display the results of the analysis.
- **results.html:**
   - A separate HTML page for displaying the results of the analysis.
   - Receive data from the server and display it in an organized layout.

**Routes:**

- **GET /:**
   - Renders the `index.html` page.
- **POST /analyze:**
   - Accepts user inputs from the form on `index.html`.
   - Calls the backend logic to analyze the Google stock data based on the inputs.
   - Renders the `results.html` page with the analysis results.

**Backend Logic:**

- A function to retrieve and analyze Google stock data using a financial data library (e.g., yfinance).
- The function can analyze data points such as historical prices, moving averages, and technical indicators to calculate insights and recommendations.
- The analysis results are then formatted and sent back to the client as a response to the POST request.

**Styling and Functionality:**

- The website can be styled using a CSSstylesheet to enhance its appearance.
- The user interface can be made mobile responsive to ensure optimal viewing on different devices.
- The application can be extended to include additional features such as historical charts, news feeds, or user profiles for personalized experiences.
